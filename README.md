🎯 Face Recognition System

A Python-based **Face Recognition System** that detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project is ideal for applications like smart attendance systems, surveillance, and secured authentication systems.

## 📸 Features

- 🔍 Real-time face detection and recognition  
- 👤 Add new users with image data  
- 🧠 Train and store face data using LBPH / Dlib / Deep Learning  
- 🕵️‍♂️ High-accuracy recognition with multiple face datasets  
- 🧾 (Optional) Attendance management system  
- 🖥️ GUI / CLI support (customizable)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, face_recognition, dlib (optional), Tkinter (if GUI used)  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / Python IDE
